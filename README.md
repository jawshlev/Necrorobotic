Core Game Pillars

Combat: Defeating enemies grants “energy” to power the robot suit. 

Movement: Player should be able to move around in an environment, and said environment should provide both combat and platforming challenges to “encourage” the player to seek out upgrades, and thus interact with the core Energy System

Resource management: Energy gradually drains over time, the rate depending on how many robot parts your character has, and if it drains completely, the character becomes very clunky and heavy to move around, with lower jumps, slower movement, and no access to their abilities until they get more. 

Teach long-term planning through choices: This is the core conflict. The less human a character is, the more energy they consume and the more aggressively they have to play to avoid running out of energy. The player can choose to skip any robot part they want, although it may make the game more difficult. Removing/undoing upgrades is more difficult than applying them. The “best” ending is given if the player collects no robot parts at all.  Short-term vs long-term benefits.
